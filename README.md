- 👋 Hi, I’m Craig!
- 👀 I’m interested in computer programming and coding, 3D animation and rendering, music production (guitar, piano, and digital music), art, drawing, and writing.
  I have a big interest in web and game development, networking, and network/system security and administration. I also love all types of gaming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Blender, Java, C#, and how to use Git and GitHub.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing, currently. Trying to catch my footing with everything first.
- 📫 How to reach me: CraigAHarrison@hotmail.com
